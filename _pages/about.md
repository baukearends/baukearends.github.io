I'm Bauke Arends, a medical doctor and a PhD candidate at the Department of Cardiology, UMC Utrecht. My research focuses on deep-learning methods for the electrocardiogram (AI-ECG), with a special interest in models that can both advance cardiovascular medicine and translate radiologyâ€™s rich imaging insights to time-series data. 

I contribute to the [MyDigiTwin](https://www.mydigitwin.nl) consortium, where we integrate ECG, imaging and omics into patient-specific digital twins, and I'm project coordinator for two TKI LSH PPP-funded projects on AI-ECG for occlusion myocardial infarction and structural heart disease.

Current research interests include:
- Structural heart disease detection
- Occlusion myocardial infarction detection
- AI-ECG attribution method evaluation
