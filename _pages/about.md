I'm Bauke Arends, a medical doctor and a PhD candidate at the Department of Cardiology, UMC Utrecht. My research focuses on deep-learning methods for the electrocardiogram (AI-ECG), with a special interest in models that can both advance cardiovascular medicine and translate radiology’s rich imaging insights to time-series data. 

I contribute to the [MyDigiTwin](https://www.mydigitwin.nl) consortium, where we integrate ECG, imaging and omics into patient-specific digital twins, and I'm project coordinator for two TKI LSH PPP-funded projects on AI-ECG for occlusion myocardial infarction and structural heart disease.

**Current research lines**

| Theme | What I’m working on |
| --- | --- |
| **Structural heart disease detection** | End-to-end models that identify cardiomyopathies and valvular disease directly from 12-lead ECGs, with the goal to improve echocardiography resource allocation.|
| **Occlusion myocardial infarction detection** | Developing models that identify occlusion myocardial infarctionusing 12-lead ECGs, with the goal to improve (prehospital) triage for patients with chest pain. |
| **Explaining AI-ECG** | Systematic evaluation of attribution methods (Saliency, Grad-CAM, DeepLIFT, etc.) to understand where the network “looks” and how these explanations hold up to sanity checks. |
