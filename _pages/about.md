My research focuses on deep learning methods for the electrocardiogram (AI-ECG), where I build and validate models that can immediately improve patient care, from pre-hospital triage to long-term risk prediction. Drawing from my background in medicine, health economics and machine learning, my work encompasses all steps of model development, including preprocessing, model development, methodological research, and implementation research.

I contribute to the [MyDigiTwin](https://www.mydigitwin.nl) consortium, where we integrate ECG, imaging and omics into patient-specific digital twins, and I'm project coordinator for two TKI LSH PPP-funded projects on AI-ECG for occlusion myocardial infarction and structural heart disease.

Current research interests include:
- Structural heart disease detection
- Occlusion myocardial infarction detection
- AI-ECG attribution method evaluation
